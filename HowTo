FFAFFURR -- Framework For Adjusting Force Fields Using Regularized Regression
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the goal is to "adjust" existing parameters of the OPLS-AA FF, it is reasonable to provide a standardized listing of parameters as input. 
Thus, parameter file "OPLS-AA.xml" is needed.
For any system already set-up with OpenMM, e.g. when using the standard OPLS-AA FF parameters that are distributed with the OpenMM package, the standardized parameters and connectivity list are taken from the inner code of OpenMM by ffaffurr.py. Here, a coordinate file is needed.

Secondly, The "input.pdb" file is the basic coordinate file that OpenMM-readable.

Thirdly, the input file "ffaffurr.input" contains the "switches" that control the behavior of the framework, e.g. what kind of parameters are to be "adjusted" or what regression model to use.

Finally, the input file "ffaffurr.input.FHI-aims-logfiles" contains a list of FHI-aims-specific (https://fhi-aims.org/) output files produced when calculating single-point DFT energies.
Obviously, these files must be produced for a set of conformers that serves as training data.
If RESP charges are specified in "ffaffurr.input", a seperate file 'resp.chrg' containing atomic RESP charges for each conformer should be included in the folders listed in ffaffurr.input.FHI-aims-logfiles.

After all input files are ready, we can use "python ffaffurr.py" to do the "adjusting". With this, we put new parameters into two files: "ffaffurr-oplsaa.xml" and "CustomForce.xml":

"ffaffurr-oplsaa.xml" includes all the parameters in standard OPLS-AA FF.

"CustomForce.xml" includes charge transfer and polarization parameters.
