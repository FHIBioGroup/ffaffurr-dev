FFAFFURR -- Framework For Adjusting Force Fields Using Regularized Regression
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the goal is to "adjust" existing parameters of the OPLS-AA FF, it is reasonable to provide a standardized listing of parameters as input.
For any system already set-up with OpenMM, e.g. when using the standard OPLS-AA FF parameters that are distributed with the OpenMM package, the standardized parameters and connectivity list are taken from the inner code of OpenMM by ffaffurr.py. Here, a coordinate file is needed.

The input.pdb file is the basic coordinate file that OpenMM-readable.

Secondly, the input file ffaffurr.input.FHI-aims-logfiles contains a list of FHI-aims-specific output files produced when calculating single-point DFT energies.
Obviously, these files must be produced for a set of conformers that serves as training data.

Finally, the input file ffaffurr.input contains the "switches" that control the behavior of the framework, e.g. what kind of parameters are to be "adjusted" or what regression model to use.

After "adjusting", we put new parameters into two files: ffaffurr-oplsaa.xml and CustomForce.xml:

ffaffurr-oplsaa.xml includes all the parameters in standard OPLS-AA FF.

CustomForce.xml includes charge transfer and polarization parameters.
